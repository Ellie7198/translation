# ICF Supports 5-year Research Program Led by Professor Dan Boneh

## The Interchain Foundation Supports the Center for Blockchain Research at Stanford

The [Interchain Foundation](https://interchain.io/) (ICF), along with five other blockchain organizations including the Ethereum Foundation, Protocol Labs, OMG, DFINITY, and Polychain Capital, have collectively committed to supporting the [Center for Blockchain Research](https://cbr.stanford.edu/) (CBR) in a 5-year program to push the boundaries of cryptocurrency research.

There is a clear alignment of interests between the ICF, which funds the development of the Cosmos Network, and Standford’s CBR.

Some of the things on our wish/to-do list which could take from the body of research that may come out of the CBR in the next 5 years are:

1. New cryptographic techniques that will allow deeper integration between Cosmos and chains like Bitcoin. See: [peg zones](https://blog.cosmos.network/the-internet-of-blockchains-how-cosmos-does-interoperability-starting-with-the-ethereum-peg-zone-8744d4d2bc3f).
2. Improvements to Tendermint consensus to increase the size of the validator set without sacrificing performance.
3. General advancement on Byzantine fault-tolerance (BFT).
4. Improving the security of zones using better fraud proofs and verifiability via Zero Knowledge of zones.
5. Better understanding and modeling of the mechanism design behind tokens and blockchains.
6. Formal analysis tools.
7. Post quantum security.
8. Enhanced privacy for Cosmos users.

The vision of the Cosmos Network has always been about advancing the infrastructural needs of the ecosystem in order to cultivate the next generation of commercial-scale decentralized applications. With this step, we are moving the lever ever closer to making this vision a reality.

> As of this writing, the Cosmos-SDK and Tendermint have reached a pivotal milestone: the Cosmos technology stack is nearing feature-completeness. [Tendermint](https://tendermint.readthedocs.io/projects/tools/en/master/) is your state-of-the-art consensus engine and the SDK is your application-specific blockchain (dAppzone) framework. See [how you can build your highly scalable blockchain](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/develop/docs/overview/overview.md) with our software stack.
