**Indeed, the inherently democratic nature of blockchain has been blockchain’s most appealing facet for me and many others. However, there seems to be a huge gap between zealous blockchain technologists, and the majority of people, who are barely aware of blockchain’s existence. How can we bridge this gap?**

Well, I think things we’ve built so far are deficient when it comes to user experience and usability. They haven’t been focuses; we’ve pretty much had the worst design software ever. A lot of people have hypothesized that eventually the “Steve Jobs of blockchain” will appear and make it user friendly. I also think the funding environment is now in a place where people can make significant investments in user experience — but so far, few projects have made those investments.

**Do you consider blockchain to be a disruptive or foundational technology? Do you think it will displace market incumbents or computing paradigms?**

I’m firmly in the disruptive camp because I’m bullish on the idea of putting markets into everything, of people being active participants of markets on a day-to-day basis. Consider the lives of most people today: they go to their job, producing value, and then they spend the rest of their day being consumers of the value that they make from their jobs. Blockchain aims to disrupt this; the whole notion of decentralization relies on the emergent notion of *prosumers*. We’ve seen some examples of this on the internet; For example, Wikipedia consists of about 50,000 prosumers who create incredibly valuable content for free, or with the purpose of gaining social capital.

With blockchain, the relevant question is this: if we give people clearer, more liquid economic incentives, will this prosumer community grow by, say, two orders of magnitude? I think it will, because people like the idea of putting their skills directly into something they can control and make money from. Instead of “I have my job that I go to,” it’s “I run a proof-of-stake validation node on these 10 networks on the side, and I have a phone beacon on my roof that makes money, and I have these games and apps like [Playlist](https://www.playlist.com/), where instead of me just being a hobbyist choosing music, it’s now a source of income on the side.” That’s the kind of world we’re trying to imagine, build, and see if people will go for.

**So essentially, blockchain is about breaking down boundaries.**

Yes, breaking down the boundaries between jobs, hobbies, and sources of income, and trying to incorporate them into a decentralized economy. The current economy involves a small number of very large entities raising all the capital, and then employing people to do all the work. And those people then turn around and consume largely from those same companies, creating a circle. The decentralization of blockchain is a way to disrupt those economic incentives — to allow capital to be allocated far more directly, for/to/through people, and to allow direct participation in the economy.

What’s amazing is how much this sounds like what people thought the Web would be like, back in 1999 — that it would be this economic dis-intermediary force. And yet it ended up being incredibly centralized into basically five companies. I think blockchain is a second swing at that idea.

**Are there any cautionary tales we may draw from the history of the Internet revolution? Looking at past mistakes, what do we need to avoid with Blockchain?**

One of the most centralizing things about the web, and a major missing piece of web technology, is that there was no built-in payment rail. Say you wanted to profit off a search engine you designed. It wasn’t enough to just build a great search engine, you also had to build an incredible surveillance-driven advertising system to make money. And that was incredibly centralizing, because it meant that nobody could directly monetize their technical effort. It was a lot easier, if you were a good technologist, to go work at Google than to build your own product. In other words, it was easier to help build Gmail inside of Google, than to build an awesome email service and charge people for it. And Google would just take care of the monetization for you, with their enormous technical infrastructure.

**Again, it’s a kind of barrier to entry, right?**

Yes. For blockchain to really succeed, it must inherently disrupt the existing monopolies, potentially including the central bank monopoly.

**Anything you’d recommend for people who want to learn more about blockchain?**

I highly recommend [Andreessen Horowitz’s “Crypto Canon”](https://a16z.com/2018/02/10/crypto-readings-resources/) for further reading on the subject.

**To sum it all up:**

- Existing blockchains are basically experiments.
- Chain investing trend allows unprecedented experimentation to test technical limits and explore solutions.
- Regulatory environment is permissive, allows people to operate businesses.
- 2 approaches to business: flock to the most permissive regulatory environment, or comply with regulations and proactively invent new ones.
- Blockchain is about simple vs. complex rules — allows fairer complex rule enforcement.
- Blockchain can reimagine markets vis-à-vis collaboration.
- Blockchain allows people to profit from contributing to the network.
- It can attract lots of interest from the public.
- Currently, UX and ease-of-use is poor.
- Blockchain is disruptive.
- Question is whether sufficient economic incentives will cause community to explode.
- 2018 blockchain similar to 1999 Web — hope for a disruptive, dis-intermediary force.
- Problem: no built-in payment rail for web, so it’s more profitable to work for Google than build your own thing.
- Blockchain must inherently disrupt monopolies.
