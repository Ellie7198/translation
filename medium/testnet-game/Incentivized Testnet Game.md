# Announcing — Incentivized Testnet Game

## Cosmos is rolling out a game called: “A Testnet of Steaks”

[EDIT June 25] The following post has been revised from the original. The details and rules of the game have been collapsed until a later post with entry instructions and rules.

The Cosmos Network is rolling out a game of high steaks — you read that right— in its multiple iterations of testnets before its highly anticipated main network is launched. The game is called “A Testnet of Steaks”. The aim is to increase participation in the testnet by putting up bounties. The testnet staking token of the Cosmos Network is called a “steak”, where the winners of the game who have demonstrated highest uptime in the face of a highly adversarial environment will walk away with a bounty.

The rules of the game are simple: compete for the most steak. Winners will be ranked in descending order by the number of steak that they have by the end of the game according to a global scoreboard.

The goal of the testnet game just weeks before launch is to simulate a mainnet environment to stress-test all the features. Since the Cosmos technology stack is near feature-completeness, the need to stress-test the simulated environment, the mechanics of the Cosmos Hub, and each and every one of the features promised in the deliverable of the MVP is vital to the success of the Cosmos Network before its mainnet comes online.

This game is not yet live. We will make a follow-up announcement letting potential participants know where to go to KYC and enter into the game. KYC is required for tax purposes and to mitigate spoof accounts. The mechanics of KYC will be announced later. To get ahead, players are encouraged to join our testnets.
