### II. Weighing the Costs & Benefits for Atom Holders

The economic viability of operating a validator is dependent on the prices of both atoms and photons, which could be entirely decoupled. The following paragraphs hopefully shed color onto the economic viability for atom holders to either set up a validator or simply delegate.

#### Tradeoffs in the Cosmos Network

The target of the Cosmos Network is to launch an Internet of Blockchains connected through a central hub. No single party should be able to control or censor the system in any way. This can be achieved by striking a balance between enabling enough independent validators to profitably run a secure validator, while at the same time ensuring that validators do not accumulate too much wealth and power (in the form of atoms) for providing their service. *The ideal system would maximize the distribution of power without jeopardizing the overall security and performance of the network.*

Cosmos uses a Proof-of-Stake BFT-based consensus system to achieve performance while maintaining decentralization, with delegators effectively voting for validators by means of delegating their atoms towards the validator they feel aligns best with their, and the overall networks’, interests. Several mechanisms designed to punish undesirable validator behavior (slashing) are also put in place.

#### The ‘Rich Get Richer’ Myth

A pervasive myth that critics of decentralized systems secured by Proof-of-Stake argue is that validators can rapidly accumulate staking tokens and eventually gain network control.

The following example uses realistic assumptions, tied back to the Cosmos Network, to show that accumulating a larger stake in the network through commision on atom block rewards will take an inordinately long time and does not lead to over-concentration of atom holdings.

- Total atom supply at launch: 230,000,000
- Average annual inflation: 10%
- Assumed average commission on atom rewards: 10%
- Annual commission income for all validators (in atoms): 2,300,000
- Profit margins: 50%
- Annual profits across all validators (in atoms) 1,150,000 (0.5% of supply)

Let’s assume that over 10 years (an eternity in blockchain time), validators can maintain high profit margins and commission rates of 50% and 10% respectively. In addition, over 10 years, validators keep all of their profits in atoms. They pay no dividends, return no money to investors, do not hedge their balance sheets by converting atoms to fiat currencies, do not invest atom rewards into growing their business or sell atoms to fund validation efforts in other PoS networks. Then (and only then!) they end up earning 5% of the total token supply from commissions after 10 years. Therefore the claim that validators will rapidly accumulate atoms is incorrect.

Let’s also look at the decision that a large atom holder, a Cosmos whale, faces with a few assumptions:

- Annual inflation: 10%
- Cosmos whale’s atom holdings: 1,000,000
- Cost of operating a validator: US$300,000 annually

Assume that validators are charging commission in atoms and the average commission rate were 20%. If the whale delegated to another validator and she were to pay 1,000,000 atoms*10%(inflation)*20%(commission) = 20,000 atoms annually for the service. So if she expects the atom price to exceed US$15, it would be rational for her to operate a validator instead of delegating.

With the ‘rich get richer’ myth out of the way, let us focus on principles of blockchain security and and how economic specifications incentivize a network of diverse validators to ensure a decentralised network.
