### Tendermint BFT Stack

Bitcoin is the intellectual ancestor of all blockchain-based cryptographic systems that we know and love today. The Tendermint protocol shares commonality with Bitcoin inasmuch as the two protocols record everything on a blockchain, yet they each provide their unique solutions to the Byzantine General’s Problem, also referred to as the consensus, or “agreement”, problem. Tendermint’s lineage is closely traced back to the world of distributed computing and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) literature in academia (e.g., see Ethan Buchman’s [thesis](https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10214/9769/Buchman_Ethan_201606_MAsc.pdf)). Whereas in the Bitcoin genesis story, after the many failed attempts of previous electronic cash systems — with the exception of PayPal — Bitcoin rose above the ashes as a censorship-resistant decentralized currency system.

The Bitcoin protocol optimizes for censorship-resistance, critically, due to its primary function as a payment system. Tendermint, on the other hand, optimizes for general Byzantine fault-tolerant distributed applications and data processing amidst a wide area network (WAN), e.g. hundreds of nodes (high node count). This distinction is nuanced and merits deeper investigation.

For context, in the world of academia, there had been very little research done on BFT systems for WAN and only for a small number of nodes — 4 to 7 at maximum — and always for a single administrative domain. As for BFT systems for WAN with a large number of nodes and for multiple administrative domains, no significant body of work has been widely adopted in practice.

Before 2009, when Bitcoin introduced a paradigm-shifting technology — the concept of a blockchain — to the world, the consensus problem in a WAN setting for high node counts was left largely unanswered. Despite solving the Two Generals’ problem, however, Bitcoin was not really an algorithm to solve consensus, in the purely theoretical sense in the research area of distributed systems. Furthering the work in the BFT domain was far from done.

In 2014, Jae Kwon, coming from a computer science and systems engineering background, envisioned a purely BFT-based protocol which would scale to the tune of hundreds of nodes in the permissionless setting with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) as the underlying security mechanism. And so [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/static/docs/tendermint.pdf) was created. Consequently, this system model designed with PoS as the primary security mechanism over a large number of validating nodes in a WAN turned out to be a significantly complex engineering endeavor, taking almost 4 years to implement in the public blockchain setting. That setting is Cosmos, slated to launch this summer in 2018.
